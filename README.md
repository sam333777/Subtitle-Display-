# Subtitle Viewer

Ever been watching a show on some *totally legal* sketchy website and realized… no subtitles?  
This little PyQt app lets you load your own `.srt` file and watch along like a civilized human.

## Features
- Big, crisp subtitles (white on black, like a pro).  
- Always-on-top window so you don’t lose it behind your 37 Chrome tabs.  
- Pause, rewind 30s, fast-forward 30s — like a DIY Netflix player.  
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Space` → Pause/Play  
  - `←` → Rewind 30s  
  - `→` → Forward 30s

## Usage
```bash
python subtitle_viewer.py your_subtitles.srt --offset 5
